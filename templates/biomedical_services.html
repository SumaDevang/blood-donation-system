        <h2>Our Biomedical Services</h2>
        <p>
            At the Blood Donation Management System, our biomedical services team plays a critical role in the blood donation process. We are committed to ensuring that every unit of donated blood is safe for transfusion, properly preserved, and efficiently distributed to meet the needs of hospitals and patients. Our comprehensive biomedical services encompass the following key areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Blood Testing:</strong> Every donation undergoes a rigorous testing process to ensure its safety and suitability for transfusion. This includes screening for infectious diseases such as HIV, hepatitis B and C, and syphilis, as well as determining blood type (ABO and Rh factor) to ensure compatibility with recipients. Our state-of-the-art laboratories use advanced diagnostic techniques to deliver accurate and reliable results, safeguarding the health of both donors and recipients.
            </li>

                <strong>Storage and Preservation:</strong> Donated blood is a precious resource that requires careful handling to maintain its life-saving properties. We store red blood cells at 1–6°C in specialized refrigerators, ensuring they remain viable for up to 42 days. Platelets are kept at room temperature (20–24°C) with continuous agitation to preserve their function for up to 5 days, while plasma is frozen at -18°C or lower to extend its shelf life to one year. These strict temperature-controlled conditions ensure that blood components are ready for use when needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Distribution:</strong> Our team works closely with hospitals to ensure a seamless supply of blood products. We prioritize urgent requests for emergencies, such as trauma cases and surgeries, while also supporting scheduled procedures like chemotherapy and organ transplants. Using a sophisticated logistics system, we track inventory levels and coordinate timely deliveries to hospitals, ensuring that the right blood type is available at the right time to save lives.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> We adhere to the highest standards of quality and safety, complying with regulations set by organizations such as the FDA and AABB (American Association of Blood Banks). Our quality assurance team conducts regular audits, monitors all stages of the blood handling process, and implements continuous improvement initiatives to maintain excellence. This includes staff training, equipment calibration, and documentation to ensure traceability and accountability at every step.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Safety Protocols:</strong> The safety of donors and recipients is our top priority. We follow strict protocols to prevent contamination and errors, including the use of sterile equipment, barcoding systems for tracking blood units, and double-checking procedures to ensure correct blood type matching. Our team is also prepared to respond to adverse events, such as transfusion reactions, by maintaining detailed records and collaborating with healthcare providers to ensure patient safety.
